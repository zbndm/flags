# Example Next.js application usingË˜ `@happykit/flags`

## Files

### `pages/_app.tsx`

This file contians the setup of `@happykit/flags`. The Environment Key is preconfigured in `.env.development` to load the flags from a HappyKit example project.

Note that in your own application, you'll need to configure an environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAGS_ENV_KEY` and set it to your Flags Environment Key. You can find this key in your project settings on [happykit.dev](https://happykit.dev).
